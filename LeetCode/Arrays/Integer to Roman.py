# Input: num = 3749
# Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
# Explanation:
# 3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
#  700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
#   40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
#    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
# Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
